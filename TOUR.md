## Points of interest

* Code re-use in GUI
* Observer-based interaction between models and UI
* Socket programming in GNU Go module
* Game as a controller object
* JRuby Swing Interaction
* Ray for Standard Ruby

## Known issues and caveats

* Synchronization issues
* Poor socket behavior during failures
* Error handling (in game and in app)
* Lack of good UI for scoring + passing
* No automated tests
* Installation process is painful

## Ideas for the future

* TBD
